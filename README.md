Welcome to the git repository for CTIN544 midterm projects! 

We expect you're totally new to git and GitHub. Here's a decent intro/tutorial for understanding what's going on:

http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1

The author has a couple of odd misunderstandings (git isn't a programming language, and the command line is still very much a part of modern computing), but she lays out the basics well. As she observes, you can use the GitHub application rather than the command line, but it's important to understand what it's doing behind the scenes.

To compress her list of important git commands even further, these are the big four:

git status
git add
git commit
git push

You can get by without branches and you can usually avoid merging as well. So please read all the explanations of commands, but focus especially on those four.
